### Simple vimrc for my personal use

#### Installation instructions
- Install `git`
- `git clone` this repository and place the `.vimrc` you just downloaded with it in the folder where your `.vimrc` is stored
- Install the packages you want:
  - Palenight is the colorscheme I use
  - NERDTree is a file explorer for vim
  - Vim Fugitive is a git wrapper for vim
  If you don't wish to use any of the above packages, simply remove the corresponding line in the `.vimrc` file, for instance:
  `Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'`
